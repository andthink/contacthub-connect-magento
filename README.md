## Introduction  

The Contacthub Magento plug-in enables you to automatically send all of the activities that your customers undertake on the e-commerce platform to Contacthub, without the need to write any code. The extension automatically collects individual customer information such as:
- The pages they visit
- The products they add to, or remove from, their shopping cart
- The orders they complete

It also ensures potentially valuable information is not lost, by retaining events and actions that are related to customers who have not yet been identified because, for example, they are not logged in, or they have not yet registered. The data is stored by Contacthub, ready to be associated with the customer as soon as they are identified later.

Installing the plug-in is very simple, while configuring it requires just a few minutes.

## Requirements  

The Contacthub Magento plug-in requires Magento CE version 1.9. Further details about Magento 1 system requirements are available on [Magento website](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/m1x/system-requirements.html).

An alternative version of the Contacthub Magento plug-in for Magento CE version 2.x is available on Github, at the address [https://github.com/contactlab/contacthub-connect-magento2](https://github.com/contactlab/contacthub-connect-magento2).

## Installing the Magento plug-in

To install the plug-in, do the following:  

- Log in to **Magento Admin**, click **System** > **Cache Management** and enable all cache types.  

![Cache Management](image/CacheManagement.png)  

**Cache Management with all cache types enabled**  

- Click **System** > **Tools** > **Compilation** and ensure that **Compiler Status** is set to **Disabled**.  

![Compiler Status](image/Compilation.png)  

**Compiler Status set to disabled**  

- Establish an FTP/SFTP/SSH connection with your website source folder.  

- Upload all of the folders and files in the extension package to the **root** folder of your Magento installation.

![Magento root](image/MagentoRoot.png)  

**Example of the Magento root folder**  

**Note:**  

You should ensure that you use the **Merge** upload mode of your client to add the new files, and do not replace any existing folders. While **Merge** is often the default setting of FTP/SFTP clients, you should check to be certain. If you are using MacOS, we recommend that you use **Transmit**.  

If you install several extensions from Amasty, they will contain some files that are the same as those in the Base package. You can overwrite these freely, as they are the system files that are used by all of our extensions.  

- Click **System** > **Cache Management** and then click **Flush Cache Storage**.  

   After you have done this, the extension installation is complete.  

- You can now enable compilation, if you need to do so, under **System** > **Tools** > **Compilation**.  

- Log out of **Magento Admin** and then log back in again, to allow Magento to refresh permissions.
